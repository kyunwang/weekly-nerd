Namely that REST is dependent on the back-end and needs many API calls to many end-points or with GraphQL which combines everything in one query and giving the power to the client who can define what data it needs.</p>\\n<p>He continued about how GraphQL can be our solution for state management, which is simpler than redux and mobx. Kitze explains that fixing the REST apis would effect into fixing the state management. And helps us choose wether we actualy need state management library when we are using GraphQL by giving us examples of stacks which can be used.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Redux is a great library, however it is overhyped and overused by many, as Dan Abramov (Creator of Redux) said himself. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>New technologies keep comming up and dissapearing, so instead of always asking <em>What is better?</em> we should ask ourselves:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What is suitable for my app</li>\\n<li>What is suitable for my team</li>\\n<li>What is suitable for our use-case</li>\\n</ul>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>GraphQL is the thing that’s eventually gonna replicate REST, but you keep telling yourself that you don’t need to learn it.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q54YDGC_t3Y\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<h2>Second talk: GraphQL at scale with AWS</h2>\\n<h6>By <em>Richard Threlkeld</em> from Amazon</h6>\\n<p>This talks was all about the features of AWS Appsync.</p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_mGa91wZ4o\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<h2>Third talk: Rethinking With React 16</h2>\\n<h6>By <em>Manjula Dube</em> from Bookmyshow</h6>\\n<p>Manjula talked about what React 16(.3) brings to the world.

The renderers are called Renderless Components which are explained in his talk at React Amsterdam 2017. But how do we mix multiple custom renderers nicely without making a mess? It can be done with the Context API, which allows us to utilize Reactivy non-React things as Ken says it. With something he calls the Registration Pattern which registers children with it's parent. With great demo combining Three.js and an Audio renderer Ken shows how the Registration Pattern can be used while playing showing some awesome visuals. </p>\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBpugV5l90c\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<p>The awesome people at React Amsterdam have recorded all the talks which you can find here:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smBND2pwdUE&#x26;t=18146s\\\">General Track</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-X3Z5A-pW4\\\">React Native Track</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Yes I wrote this a month after the conference</em></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"May 23, 2018\",\"path\":\"/react-amsterdam-2018\",\"title\":\"Short visit at React Amsterdam\"}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---react-amsterdam-2018-3b10fe4bab3a6d307099.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>All of the sudden I had the opportunity to got to React Amsterdam albeit just for a few hours.
