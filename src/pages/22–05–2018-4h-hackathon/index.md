title: "A 4 hours hackathon"

Draft

22 / 5 / 18

On the 18th of May I participated in a hackathon which lasted for 4 hours. The organisor and client of the hackathon was Master Digital Design. They came with a few cases we could select to work for. The cases were from the students and instructors from the Master Digital Design. The goal of the was to help the clients with their concepts and eventually help with making a prototype.

The case I have selected was called *The future of sleep* from Matthew. His concept was about the possibilities of manipulating sleep in the future. About what TDCS (Transcranial direct current stimulation) and TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) could do to affect ones sleep.

Together with a group of 6, me included, we helped Matthew think about the concept. We thought about use-cases, possible side-effects, possible safety/security issues, possible unforseen scenarios and preventions. Together with [Sam Gulinker](https://github.com/Sam-Guliker) we tried to setup a Native prototype made with React Native with the core function of said app in the last 2 hours.

The core function were to authenticate/verify the user with touch ID, set a timer of how long the user wants to sleep and a countdown timer for readying the user to sleep. (Theory should be coupled with this to understand the implications)

It was an interesting topic to think about and help Matthew out with. Thinking about the possible implications such a product may have and thinking about the way how this could be made.

Prototyping was really rushed as we only had around 1:30 to 2 hours to set it up and get it working. We were focused on how much effort it would take to get the core functionality in to get a time estimation. The only problem we encountered was the building of the application with xCode. This was a real pain and took around 30 minutes with long compiling time included. (One of the problems was that a device support file was not fould, which in my opinion should be included with xCode)

Because of this the prototype is really barebones with no styling. We did accomplish to get touch id working with a timer but not dynamic with user input.

It seemed that we did help out a lot with thinking together with Matthew about the concept, asking questions, estimating problems, scenarios and possible hard aspects in developing.

The hackathon was really fun, but sadly we only had 4 hours for discussing and prototyping, therefore not a lot could be realised. I do feel we helped Matthew with some of his problems and could steer him in a good way.
