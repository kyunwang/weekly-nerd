title: "A 5 hours hackathon"
draft: false
---

On the 18th of May, I participated in a hackathon which lasted for 5 hours. The organizer and client of the hackathon were the master program Digital Design. They came with a few cases we could select to work for. The cases were from the students and instructors from the master. The goal was to help the clients with their concepts and eventually help with making a prototype.

The case I have selected was called *The future of sleep* from Matthew. His concept was about the possibilities of manipulating sleep in the future. About what TDCS (Transcranial direct current stimulation) and TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) could do to affect one's sleep.

Together with a group of 6, I included, we helped Matthew think about the concept. We thought about use-cases, possible side-effects, safety/security issues, unforeseen scenarios, and preventions. Together with [Sam Gulinker](https://github.com/Sam-Guliker), I set up a Native prototype made with React Native with the core function of the said app in the last 2 hours.

The core function was to authenticate the user with touch ID, set a timer of how long the user wants to sleep and a countdown timer.

It was an interesting topic to think about and help Matthew out with. Thinking about the possible implications such a product may have and thinking about the way how this could be made.

Prototyping was really rushed as we only had around 1:30 to 2 hours to set it up and get it working. With this prototype, we tried to create a production time estimation. The only problem we encountered was the building of the application with Xcode. This was a real pain and took around 30 minutes, long compiling time excluded. (One of the problems was that a device support file was not found, which in my opinion should have been included with Xcode)

Because of this, the prototype is really barebones with no styling. We did accomplish to get touch id working with a timer but not dynamic with user input.

We did help a lot with thinking together with Matthew about the concept, asking questions, estimating problems, scenarios and possible pain points in developing.

The hackathon was really fun, but sadly we only had 5 hours of discussing and prototyping, therefore not a lot could be realized. I do feel we helped Matthew with some of his problems and could steer him in a good way.
