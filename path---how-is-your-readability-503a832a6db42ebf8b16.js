When you read or write and when implementing it on something. Nor is it the sexiest thing. Let us take a minute to explore this topic.</p>\n<h2>Types of reading disabilities</h2>\n<p>There are three general categories of disabilities, not just exclusive to vision. Reading issues, for instance, can be linked to <strong>Visual and Cognitive impairment</strong>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Categories</th>\n<th>Visual</th>\n<th>Cognitive</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Permanent</td>\n<td>Blindness</td>\n<td>Dyslexia, Hyperlexia (Autism/ADHD)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Temporal</td>\n<td>Eye infection</td>\n<td>Fluency</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Situational</td>\n<td>Distraction</td>\n<td>Stressful context</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How do we read</h2>\n<p>As reading experience depends on <strong>context</strong> and <strong>experience</strong>, we first need to know how we read to be able to improve the experience.\nSo how do we read?</p>\n<p>We do not read in a linear fashion but in <strong>saccades</strong>. This means that we do not read every word one by one but let our eyes jump from word to word.\nDuring the jump, we take pauses called <strong>fixations</strong>. During the fixation, everything except the focus will be blurry.</p>\n<figure class="blog-post-figure">\n    <img src="https://hamiltonianofdesign.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/saccades-and-fixations1.jpg" alt="Saccades and fixation example" style="width:100%">\n    <figcaption>Hamiltonian of Design: <a href="https://hamiltonianofdesign.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/saccades-and-fixations1.jpg">https://hamiltonianofdesign.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/saccades-and-fixations1.jpg</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Words are read by the identifying features of the letters. The difference between <strong>Readability</strong> and <strong>NOT READABILITY</strong> for example. The non-capped word is easier identifiable because of the distinct features of the letters.</p>\n<h2>Points to keep in mind</h2>\n<p>There are 4 points to keep in mind to improve readability. The 4C\'s of Readability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Continuity</strong>: Is the repeating of information until the user reaches his goal/endpoint.</li>\n<li><strong>Conspicuity</strong>: Being eye-catching and understandable to everyone. It should be visually differentiable like a title or block-quote.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Be consistent in wording, type, language. Your tone shouldn\'t change along the way. And be consistent in the purpose of your text e.g. the purpose of the titles should be the same.</li>\n<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: The message should be clear and understandable to everyone. The message should be identifiable directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Endnote</h2>\n<p>In this article I experimented with using linebreaks, emphasizing and different element to display information. Was it easier to read and could you find what you were looking for more quickly?
